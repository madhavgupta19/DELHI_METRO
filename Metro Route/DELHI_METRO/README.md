# Delhi Metro Route Finder

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Delhi Metro Route Finder project! This application is designed to help users find the best route to take when traveling from one station to another within the Delhi Metro network. Built using C++ with a focus on graphs, standard template library (STL) functions, and various data structures, this project provides efficient route planning and navigation, including station changes and line transitions.

## Features
- **Graph-based Route Finding**: Utilizes graph algorithms to find the shortest and most efficient routes between stations.
- **Line Transitions**: Provides detailed information on which metro lines to switch and at which stations for optimal travel.
- **Login and Registration**: Includes a secure login and registration system implemented in C++ to manage user access and maintain user-specific settings or preferences.
- **Interactive Console Application**: User-friendly console interface for entering start and destination stations, displaying routes, and managing user accounts.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language used for the project.
- **Graphs**: Data structures and algorithms to represent and navigate the metro network.
- **STL Functions**: Leveraged for efficient data manipulation and algorithm implementation.
- **File I/O**: Used for storing and retrieving user login details securely.
- **Data Structures**: Includes arrays, vectors, maps, and other structures to handle metro data and user information.
